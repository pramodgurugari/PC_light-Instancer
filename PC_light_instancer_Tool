*(PC = Point Cloud)*

## Overview

**PC – Light Instancer** is a production-ready lighting tool designed to streamline and accelerate lighting workflows in **Houdini Solaris (USD)**. It enables artists to create and manage **large numbers of instanced lights** driven entirely by **Point Cloud (PC) data**, while maintaining a clean, efficient, and fully USD-compliant setup.

Using a single **master light**, the tool procedurally generates **N number of light instances** based on point cloud positions and directions. Lights are automatically positioned, oriented, and optionally randomized, making the tool ideal for **large-scale environments, architectural lighting, set extensions, and layout-driven lighting workflows**.

Built natively for **Solaris / LOPs**, PC – Light Instancer follows USD best practices and integrates seamlessly into modern, production-scale pipelines.

---

## What “PC” Means

**PC** stands for **Point Cloud**.

The tool uses point cloud data—points and their attributes—to:

* Define light **positions**
* Automatically derive **light orientation** from point direction
* Drive **procedural and scalable** lighting layouts

This approach allows lighting to be **layout-driven**, **non-destructive**, and **highly efficient**, especially in complex USD scenes.

---

## Key Features

* Create **instanced light arrays** from a single Solaris light
* Generate **N number of light instances** without duplicating light nodes
* Drive light placement using **Point Cloud (PC) data**
* Fully **USD-compliant**, working natively inside Solaris / LOP networks
* **Centralized control** — modify the master light and update all instances instantly
* **Automatic light orientation** based on point cloud direction
* **Randomized exposure** with artist-defined minimum and maximum values
* Optional **random color variation** per light
* Optional **per-light IES profile support**
* Lightweight and **memory-efficient** compared to duplicating lights
* Clean, **non-destructive** and pipeline-safe setup
* Compatible with **Karma**, **Arnold for Solaris**, and other USD-based renderers

---

## Advantages & Smart Features

### Automatic Light Direction from Point Cloud

Lights are automatically oriented using point cloud direction data. This removes the need to manually adjust:

* Light direction
* Axis orientation
* Rotation values

The result is **consistent, predictable lighting** across large instanced arrays with minimal setup time.

---

### Exposure Randomization

Each light instance can receive a random exposure value within user-defined minimum and maximum ranges, enabling:

* Natural lighting variation
* Faster look-development
* More believable large-scale lighting setups

All exposure controls remain procedural and adjustable at any stage.

---

### Random Color Variation

Optional per-light random color variation helps break visual uniformity and adds realism, making the tool ideal for:

* Street lights
* Interior practical lights
* Architectural lighting
* Environment and background lighting

---

### Per-Light IES Support

Artists can optionally assign **IES profiles per light**, allowing:

* Real-world accurate light distribution
* Physically believable architectural and practical lighting
* Renderer-supported IES workflows inside Solaris

---

### Artist-Friendly Controls

All variations and behaviors are:

* Procedural and non-destructive
* Easily enabled or disabled
* Controlled through simple global parameters
* Instantly reflected across all light instances

This allows rapid iteration without breaking USD instancing or scene structure.

---

## Scalability & Performance

With **PC – Light Instancer**, artists can generate **hundreds or thousands of lights** while keeping scenes lightweight and efficient.

By leveraging **USD instancing**, the tool provides:

* **Faster render times**, even with massive light counts
* **Improved viewport performance**
* **Low memory usage** compared to duplicated lights
* **Easy global control** from a single master light

This ensures scenes remain **fast to render, easy to control, and simple to manage**, even in extremely large production environments.

---

## Why PC – Light Instancer

Traditional lighting workflows in Solaris often involve repetitive setups that can:

* Slow down iteration
* Create node clutter
* Increase memory usage
* Make late-stage global changes difficult

**PC – Light Instancer** removes this overhead by:

* Using **point cloud–driven USD instancing**
* Keeping USD stages **clean and readable**
* Allowing **instant global updates**
* Maintaining optimized, pipeline-friendly USD structures

This allows lighting artists to focus on **creative decisions**, not technical repetition.

---

## Typical Use Cases

* Environment and architectural lighting
* Repetitive lighting patterns such as:

  * Street lights
  * Ceiling panels
  * Stadium or arena lights
  * Practical lights in large sets
* Large-scale USD scenes requiring optimized lighting
* Procedural, layout-driven lighting setups
* Fast look-dev and lighting block-outs
* Set extensions and background lighting

---

## How It Works

1. Create or select a **master light** in Solaris
2. Provide **Point Cloud data** (points with position and direction)
3. Use **PC – Light Instancer** to generate a USD-instanced light array
4. Adjust master light or tool parameters:

   * Exposure / intensity
   * Color
   * Randomization ranges
   * IES profiles
5. All light instances update **instantly and non-destructively**

The setup integrates cleanly into existing LOP networks and remains fully USD-compliant.

---

## Performance & USD Benefits

* Uses **USD instancing** for optimal memory efficiency
* Designed for scenes with **hundreds or thousands of lights**
* Faster viewport interaction compared to duplicated lights
* Clean hierarchy suitable for **shot overrides and USD layering**

---

## Renderer Support

✅ Karma (CPU & XPU)
✅ Arnold for Solaris
✅ Other USD-compatible renderers supporting light instancing

> **Note:** Renderer-specific attributes depend on each renderer’s USD implementation.
